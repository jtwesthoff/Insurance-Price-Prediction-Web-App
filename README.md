# Insurance Price Prediction Web App

This project provides a web application for predicting insurance prices based on a trained machine learning model. It consists of a Jupyter Notebook (`modelMaker.ipynb`) where the model is trained, a Python file (`app.py`) that launches the web application locally, and two HTML files (`index.html` and `prediction.html`) for the user interface.

## Files

- `modelMaker.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for training the insurance price prediction model.
- `app.py`: Python script for launching the web application using Flask.
- `index.html`: HTML file for the homepage of the web application.
- `prediction.html`: HTML file for displaying the insurance price prediction results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jtwesthoff/Insurance-Price-Prediction-Web-App
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


3. Train the model using `model.ipynb`.

4. Run the Flask web application using `app.py`.

5. Access the web application through a web browser.

## Note

Ensure that the paths and configurations in the files (`app.py`, `index.html`, and `prediction.html`) match your environment setup.
